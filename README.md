# What is XOR encryption?
- XOR Encryption algorithm is an easy to implement method of symmetric encryption
- You can read more about it on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XOR_cipher)
# How to use?
![](https://github.com/Mini-Ware/File-Locker/blob/main/preview.png)
1) Clone this repository
```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/Mini-Ware/File-Locker
```
2) To lock a file, run the following commands
```shell
$ cd File-Locker
$ chmod +x run.sh
$ ./run.sh <file name>
```
3) To unlock that file, run the following commands
```shell
$ ./run.sh <file name>
```
# How secure is this?
- Methods such as factoring could possibly break XOR encryption
- XOR encryption is NOT the most secure way of encrypting data
- You can read more about it on [Wikipedia](https://en.m.wikibooks.org/wiki/Cryptography/Breaking_Vigen%C3%A8re_cipher)
